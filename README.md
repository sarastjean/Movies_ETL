After completing the Challenge for Module 8, I came to the below assumptions:
  -	Cleaning data can take a decent amount of time before true analysis can be formed
  - Free data sources will not always be formatted nicely and will involve extra cleaning and mining
  - Cleaning data on how they do it can be interpreted differently depending on the analyst so the results of the data can be different if the same project is given to two people
  - With the sheer amount of data, there can be problems in the middle of the dataset so it is good to look at columns/rows at random
  - Analysts can use multiple programs to clean and analyze data. In this challenge, we used Python and SQL
